# Author-Peter Ludikar, Gary Singer
# Description-An Add-In for making dog-bone fillets.

# Peter completely revamped the dogbone add-in by Casey Rogers and Patrick Rainsberry and David Liu
# Some of the original utilities have remained, but a lot of the other functionality has changed.

# The original add-in was based on creating sketch points and extruding - Peter found using sketches and extrusion to be very heavy
# on processing resources, so this version has been designed to create dogbones directly by using a hole tool. So far the
# the performance of this approach is day and night compared to the original version.

# Select the face you want the dogbones to drop from. Specify a tool diameter and a radial offset.
# The add-in will then create a dogbone with diameter equal to the tool diameter plus
# twice the offset (as the offset is applied to the radius) at each selected edge.
